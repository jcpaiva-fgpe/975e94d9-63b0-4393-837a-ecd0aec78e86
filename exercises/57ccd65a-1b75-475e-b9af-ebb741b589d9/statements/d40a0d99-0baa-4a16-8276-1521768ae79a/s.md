To access the properties of an object you need to choose one of two ways:
\
dot notation
```
let myObject = {
    prop1: 1,
    prop2: 2
}

console.log(myObject.prop1);

>>> 1
```
\
bracket notation
```
let myObject = {
    prop1: 1,
    prop2: 2
}

console.log(myObject["prop2"]);

>>> 2
```

Print all property values of _amazingObject_.
