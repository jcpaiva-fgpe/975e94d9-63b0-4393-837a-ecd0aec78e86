You can update object properties at any time, take a look at this example:
```
let myCat = {
    isHungry: false,
    isClean: true,
    name: "cool cat"
}

myCat.isHungry = true;
console.log(myCat);

>>> true
```
\
Try to update the _isCool_ property of _myObject_ by changing its value to _true_.
