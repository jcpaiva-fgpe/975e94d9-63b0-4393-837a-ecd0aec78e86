The backslash `\` is used to insert apostrophes, new lines, quotes, and other special characters into a text string.
\
Check the table below, it lists some of the special characters available to use in JavaScript:
| Code |   Outputs  |
| ---- | ---------- |
|\'	   |single quote|
|\"	|double quote|
|\&	|ampersand|
|\\	|backslash|
|\n	|new line|
|\r	|carriage return|
|\t	|tab|
|\b	|backspace|
|\f	|form feed|
\

While applying only a single _console.log()_ statement, display a string that starts with the symbol (forward slash) / and on the beginning of the next line will be the (backslash) \ shown.
