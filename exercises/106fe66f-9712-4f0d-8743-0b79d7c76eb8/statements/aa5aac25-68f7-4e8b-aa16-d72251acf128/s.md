JavaScript allows you to store several pieces of data in one place - an _array_.
\
An array declaration begins with an opening square bracket _[_ and ends with a closing one _]_. You need also to put a comma between each entry, take a look at this example:
```
let bestSongs = ["Hello", "Last Christmas", "Final Countdown"];
```
Try to modify the new array _myArray_ so that it contains exactly two elements.
