JavaScript allows to use variables in order to store values of any type.

\
In order to create a variable in JavaScript, we need to put a special keyword in front of it - _var_. There are two more keywords to store variables _let_ and _const_, but we will learn about them later in this course.

`var ourAmazingName;`

\
Take a look at the name of the variable - ourAmazingName. This is the JavaScript variable naming convention, very popular also among other programming languages. This naming convention is called camel case.

\
_ourAmazingName_ variable is empty. To ensure it is storing anything we need to set its value.

\
`var ourAmazingName = 1;`

\
This way _ourAmazingName_ variable stores a value of 1.

\
**Change the code to ensure that the variable _myNumber_ stores a value of 100.**
