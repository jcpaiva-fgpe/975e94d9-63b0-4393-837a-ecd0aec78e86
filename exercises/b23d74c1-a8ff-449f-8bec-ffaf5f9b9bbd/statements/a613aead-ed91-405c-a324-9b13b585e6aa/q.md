JavaScript allows to use variables in order to store values of any type.

In order to creating a variable in JavaScript, we need to put a special keyword in front of it - var. There are two more keywords to store variables, but we will learn about them later in this course.

`var ourAmazingName;`

Take a look at the name of the variable - ourAmazingName. This is the JavaScript variable naming convention, very popular also among other programming languages. This naming convention is called camel case.

ourAmazingName variable is empty. To ensure it is storing anything we need to set its value.

`var ourAmazingName = 1;`

This way ourAmazingName variable stores a value of 1.

Try to create a variable _myVariable_ which will store a value of 2. Look at the _ourAmazingName_ example above if you get stuck.
