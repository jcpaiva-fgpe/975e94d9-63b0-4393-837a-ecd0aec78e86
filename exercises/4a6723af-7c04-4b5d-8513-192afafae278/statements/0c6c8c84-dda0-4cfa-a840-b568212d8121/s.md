Unlike strings, you can easily change the content of an array.
\
Here's an example:
```
let coolArray = [1, 2, 3];
coolArray[0] = 15;
console.log(coolArray[0]);

>>> 15
```
ourArray now has the value `[15, 2, 3]`.
\
Try to modify the existing _myArray_ variable by changing its first index to a value of 15.
