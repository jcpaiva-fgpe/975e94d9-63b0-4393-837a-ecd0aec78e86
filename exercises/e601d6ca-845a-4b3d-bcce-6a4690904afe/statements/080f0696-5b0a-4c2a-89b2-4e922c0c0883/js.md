You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.
\
In this exercise we will learn about a _while_ loop.
_while_ loop runs while a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.
```
let greatArray = [];
let i = 0;
while(i < 5) {
  greatArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
```
In the code example above, the _while_ loop will execute 5 times and append the numbers 0 through 4 to greatArray.

\
Convert the following case, while user is inserting the value for the age and its value is under 18, instead of _Underage._ the program should display _Still X years until the age of majority._, 
use the correct number instead of X,
\
e.g. for someone aged 15 it would be 3, and aged 17 â€“ 1.
