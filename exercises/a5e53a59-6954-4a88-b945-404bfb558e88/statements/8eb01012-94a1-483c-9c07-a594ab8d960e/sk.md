You can use JavaScript in browsers to manipulate the page. However, it is not the only way to use JS. It is also possible to run a backend server using _Node.js_ - a specific environment for JavaScript.
Browsers and servers allow different things and have other purposes, but there's one tool available in both - a *console*.

\
You can find the console on your very right or, on the mobile device, down below. It helps you debug the code.

\
As you probably already noticed the _console.log()_ method allows you to "print" the output of what's within it's parentheses to the console. In real coding work it will likely be the most helpful debugging tool.
You can place it in some strategic areas of your code and show values of variables and ensure your calculations are correct.

\
If you haven't solve yet the previous exercises, here's a small example to print the string "Hello!" to the console:
```
console.log('Hello!');
```

\
**Use the _console.log()_ method to print the value of the variable _second_ before the calculation of sum. Please, don't change the rest of the code.**

\
_PS You can notice that the console is also available in Developer tools in your Chrome's menu or Web Console in Firefox's menu. You can check it later._
