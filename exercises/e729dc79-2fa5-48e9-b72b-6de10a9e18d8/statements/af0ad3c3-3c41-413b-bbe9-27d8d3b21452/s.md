As you probably already noticed it is possible to connect strings (JavaScript converts some data types into objects automatically, that's why it's also possible to connect strings and numbers). In JavaScript we use the `+` operator to connect `String` values, it is called the _concatenation_ operator.
\
You can connect two or more strings and create a new one by _concatenating_ them together.
\
Example
```
let bigString = "Wow" + "," + " we are connected" + " " + "now";
console.log(bigString);
>>> Wow, we are connected now
```
\
There are some variables already available in the code, connect them to print this message:
`I come first. I come second.`
\
Don't forget the space between!
