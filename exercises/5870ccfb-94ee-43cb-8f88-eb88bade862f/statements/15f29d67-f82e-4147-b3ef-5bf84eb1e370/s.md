There's an exponent operator in JavaScript - _base**exponent_. For example `5 ** 2` returns 25, which is the same as `5 * 5`. 
\
You can sometimes see exponents expressed using the older _Math.pow()_ method. It works almost identical. For example, in `Math.pow(2,3)`, 2 is the base and 3 is the exponent, so the result will be 8.

Calculate the square root of the product of two arithmetic means: 4 and 16, as well as 5 and 15. You can use the new exponent operator or the old _Math.pow()_ method.
