You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.
\
The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a _for_ loop because it runs for a specific number of times.
\
Take a look at this example:
```
let greatArray = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  greatArray.push(i);
}
```
greatArray will now have the value [0,1,2,3,4].
\
Write a program that displays the squares of natural numbers from 1 to 9 in sequence. Use the _for_ loop and the range function and the exponentiation operator.
