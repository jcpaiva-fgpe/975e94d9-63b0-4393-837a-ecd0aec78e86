Comments are an amazing way to leave some notes to yourself or other programmers who will try to figure out what the code does. The comment does not contain commands, but plain information (in natural language, such as English).

There are two basic ways to add comments in JavaScript:

- Ignore the current line using double slash <code>//</code>.
<code>// This is a comment</code>


- Add a multi-line comment beginning with <code>/*</code> and ending with <code>*/</code>
<code>
    /* This is
    a multi-line
    comment */
</code>
