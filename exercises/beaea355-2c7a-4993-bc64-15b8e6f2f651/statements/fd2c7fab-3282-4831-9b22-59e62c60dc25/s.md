If you don't know yet how array work, try to solve other exercises in this challenge.
\
Let's create a shopping list in the variable `myShoppingList`. This list should be a multi-dimensional array which means that this array will contain other arrays.
\
Each array should have two elements. The first element will represent the item that you need to buy, whereas the second one - the quantity. Take a look at this example:
```
["Carrot", 2]
```
Here's what we need to buy:
- 2 tomatoes
- 1 onion
- 1 garlic
\
 Don't miss anything! (and ensure that you've used a capital first letter and a singular form)
