Previously we used similar code to store text:
```
var myName = "An amazing name";
```
\
"An amazing name" is a _string literal_. You can call it _string_ because it's a series of characters surrounded by double or single quotes.
\
Create a variable clientsName and assign it a value of "John Smith". Make sure to add it before the _console.log()_ method.
